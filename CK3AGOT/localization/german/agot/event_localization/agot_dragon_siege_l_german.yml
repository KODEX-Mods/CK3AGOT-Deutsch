Finally I see an opening, a group of archers who have been foolish enough to gather all together. Only kept in cover by a small archway, and I direct [sieging_dragon.GetName] to dive to strike!\n\nAs I do, I see the trap all too late. Above the archway a group of defenders have been waiting on an adjacent roof, and as we swoop down they #italic jump#! towards [sieging_dragon.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]!\n\nThough many miss and shatter on the stone beneath, some of the brave fools find purchase, their downward thrusts finding their mark and digging the men onto [sieging_dragon.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] held by their spears and swords.

Arrows fly from every window, all aimed straight at me!\n\nThough [sieging_dragon.GetFirstName] raises [sieging_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] wings to shield me, many find their mark, and I feel their bite deep into my flesh.

We have been burning their defenses from one side of the keep to the other, focusing on those which may house weapons and men before turning on those that would block our men from entering.\n\nAs we turn to the last of these, I see a lone man on a horse — somehow having managed to escape the flames — ride towards us, a spear in his hand as if to lance us! Such bravery, or foolishness, I cannot tell, but as I direct [sieging_dragon.GetNameNoTooltip] to turn and face him, I am surprised to see the man's spear fly from his hands, and strike me square in the chest! The air is driven from my lungs, and I cannot even howl with [sieging_dragon.GetFirstNameNoTooltip].\n\nI am dimly aware of the lurch as [sieging_dragon.GetNameNoTooltip] rises into the sky, my limp form strapped down, head lolling back to stare at the sky.
