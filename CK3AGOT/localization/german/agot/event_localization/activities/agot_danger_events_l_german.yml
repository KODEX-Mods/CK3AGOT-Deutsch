A scout's voice rings out through the tension, drawing my attention as he unsheathes his sword, pointing it ahead.

 agot_danger.0003.desc: "As I traverse the ice sheet, carefully navigating around and through the crevasses and gullies that score its surface, I hear a faint yelp behind me. As I turn to follow the sound I see [crevasse_fallerinto.GetName], the laggard at the rear of my entourage, clinging to the edge of a crevasse. [crevasse_fallerinto.GetHerHis|U] sled hangs down beneath [crevasse_fallerinto.GetHerHim]. [crevasse_fallerinto.GetHerHis|U] face twisting to horror as [crevasse_fallerinto.GetSheHe] screams out for me, desperately fighting against the weight of the sled pulling [crevasse_fallerinto.GetHerHim] towards [crevasse_fallerinto.GetHerHis] doom."

 agot_danger.0004.desc: "Traveling through the unforgiving wilderness that stretches beyond the Wall is difficult enough on a good day. Today, it seems, will not be one of those. The air jabs its way into every gap in my furs and cloak, and the howling gales pummel my senses. I know the clouds above will carry with them snow to blind me as well. With the snows will also come wet, and with wet will come freezing. Shelter might save lives now."
 agot_danger.0004.a: "I know for a fact that there is a cave nearby!"
 agot_danger.0004.a.tt: "You will shelter in a cave until the gale calms."

 agot_danger.0005.desc: "I leap into the dark sanctuary of the cave just as the first snows start to fling themselves down from the clouds above. The howling of the wind still haunts us inside, but the walls of the cave are thick, and they will shelter us from the worst of the cold.\n\nAs I step further into the cave, my eyes adjusting to the darkness I have no torches to dispel, I am surprised to find paintings waiting for me deeper within the cave. Figures of some folk who used this place for shelter before us."
 agot_danger.0005.a: "Look at these wall paintings, they must be ancient!"

 agot_danger.0006.title: "$travel_danger_prefix$ The Flesh-Stripping Wind: Ancestral Paintings"
 agot_danger.0006.desc: "Looking closely at the cave paintings, I see they do not all belong to one people. The histories of a dozen clans and tribes line the walls, telling of their struggles and their triumphs. This place sheltered them all, as it shelters us now. These walls tell their stories, like I can hear their ghosts whispering to me through the distant sounds of the wind. As I examine the paintings in more detail, several start to call to me.\n\nWhich shall I focus on?"
 agot_danger.0006.a: "These rows of small pictures, there's a pattern to them. Is this poetry?"
 agot_danger.0006.a.tt: "While trying to decipher the poem, you will inadvinadvertently compose a few pieces of your own."
 agot_danger.0006.b: "I recognize that scene; our clan founder slaying the one-tusked, white mammoth!"

 agot_danger.0007.title: "$travel_danger_prefix$ The Flesh-Stripping Wind: Waking the Host"
 agot_danger.0007.desc: "As I start to delve deeper into the cave, I find the bones of both beast and folk lining the floor. I pause as it dawns on me that some of the bones still have meat attached, and glisten with crimson blood in our limited light. I start to instinctually reach for a weapon just as the hulking form of a thickly muscled bear steps into view. Blood trickles in steady drips from its mouth as it rears back and roars a challenge."
 agot_danger.0007.a: "This cave isn't big enough for the two of us."
 agot_danger.0007.b: "Everybody, ready your spears!"

 agot_danger.0008.desc: "I stand over the dying bear, its blood coating my weapon as the beast draws its last gasping breath. Its body goes limp on the floor of its former den, and I breathe a sigh of relief. I look back at my remaining band with a smirk, this bear will be quite a story. They all wait for me now, knowing that I get first choice of a trophy from the beast we've slain."
 agot_danger.0008.a: "Given what we've been through, I can't say no to that lush pelt."
 agot_danger.0008.a.tt: "You obtain a Bear Hide court artifact."

 agot_danger.0009.title: "$travel_danger_prefix$ On Thin Ice"
 agot_danger.0009.desc: "In the far north, there are hardly any roads to speak of, and even firmly beaten paths are few and far between. The frigid wastes are dotted with icy mountains and crevasses, and often the only section of clear and flat terrain is a frozen river. Our party has come across one, presenting an opportunity to use it as a road for the next part of our journey. This time of the year, however, the thickness of the ice is suspect, making a safe crossing over the treacherous terrain uncertain."
