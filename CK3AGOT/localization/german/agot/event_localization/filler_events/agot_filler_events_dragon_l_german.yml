 agot_filler_dragon.0002.t: "The Storming of the Dragonpit"
 agot_filler_dragon.0002.desc.intro: "Horrific news! The population of [dragonpit_location.GetNameNoTier], seemingly tired of [ROOT.Char.GetHouse.GetBaseName] rule, have attempted the insane! I am told that a massive mob, numbering in the thousands at least, has stormed the dragonpit!\n\nHundreds now lay dead, most from the dragons held within, and many more when the dome was brought down on top of them! The rubbled remains are now naught but a scene of blood and charred bones. "
 agot_filler_dragon.0002.desc.escaped_only: "Fortunately all the beasts housed therein have escaped without injury. I am told they are now roaming the countryside, and will take time and effort to gather once again."
 agot_filler_dragon.0002.desc.wounded_only: "Though some were wounded in the fighting, I am told that all housed therein have escaped. Apparently, they are now roaming the countryside, and will take time and effort to gather once again."
 agot_filler_dragon.0002.desc.died_only: "Not a movement was seen from the rubble once the dome collapsed. My guards and servants alike tell me to hold out hope, but I fear that all the dragons housed within have perished, either due to some lucky fool in the mob, or the collapse itself."
 agot_filler_dragon.0002.desc.escaped_and_wounded: "Fortunately it seems that all of our dragons lived, though some seemed wounded as they flew away from the collapsed structure. However, it will take time and effort to rebuild the dragonpit, much less gather the dragons once again."
 agot_filler_dragon.0002.desc.escaped_and_died: "Though fortunately, at least one seems to have escaped unharmed, flying away quickly as the pit was stormed, others seem to have not relented until the building itself fell around them. Those were either slain by the mad mob or crushed once the building collapsed."
 agot_filler_dragon.0002.desc.wounded_and_died: "Though some of our dragons seem to have escaped, all are either injured or dead. I'm told that corpses of man and dragon both still lay under tons of rock and rubble, and those that did escape the carnage will take time to heal from their injuries."
 agot_filler_dragon.0002.desc.escaped_and_wounded_and_died: "It must have been a truly chaotic sight. I'm told that though some shapes were seen flying away, we have tragically lost some of our most prized assets. Those that did escape the carnage will take time to heal from their injuries and may be difficult to gather once again."
 agot_filler_dragon.0002.desc.dragon_died: "\n\nMost tragic of all, mine own [right_dragon_head.GetName] is amongst those slain."
 agot_filler_dragon.0002.desc.dragon_wounded: "\n\nFortunately, mine own [right_dragon_head.GetName] seems to have survived the atrocity, though [right_dragon_head.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] was wounded in the fighting."

 agot_filler_dragon.0002.a: "The people of [dragonpit_location.GetNameNoTier] will face blood and fire!"

The debts I now face are considerable, and my financiers tell me that it will take a long time before we can be considered solvent again.\n\nAlongside the sheets of financial updates before me is a pamphlet; a mummer's show is taking place in [ROOT.Char.GetCapitalLocation.GetTitle.GetDefinitiveName] this week, but I am told that it is already fully booked. Such interest by the smallfolk! I can't imagine the troupe faces the difficulties I do now...\n\nAn idea forms in my head. I am the rider of [ROOT.Var('current_dragon').Char.GetFirstName], and I have been told to see us fly is a wondrous sight! Perhaps if I were to run a show, I'd be able to raise the same level of interest? While some might think such mummery is beneath a ruler and rider, my debt situation would certainly be alleviated."
 agot_filler_dragon.0006.a: "A live dragon for gold! Come one, come all!"

Though it has occasionally proven dangerous and caused the odd complaint, [worshiped_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] has become a fact of life for the people. Today however, I have received a strange piece of news from my local administrators.\n\nIt seems that, contrary to the wariness to be expected when dealing with a beast such as [worshiped_dragon.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], the local peasants have begun #italic worshiping#! the creature! I'm told that every week they bring [worshiped_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHim')] tribute in the form of meats, and by some of the more frantic reports, even live animal sacrifices!\n\nThough no deaths have yet been reported, the hazards of such activities are obvious."

 agot_filler_dragon.0011.desc.massacre: "It was a slaughter.\n\nThe peasantry, drunk on religious fervor, ale, and whatever else their strange practices held sacred, did not even see the mounting attack from behind. The unarmored and unarmed men were slaughtered before they could even form a defensive line. What little resistance they did offer was crushed. The men died, the women and children either met the same fate or fled back to their homes.\n\nOnce [worshiped_dragon.GetFirstName] wandered into the feast, far more than simple meats awaited [worshiped_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHim')]. Even after [worshiped_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] cooked the bodies in dragonfire, it seems there were more to feast on than [worshiped_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] could enjoy. After devouring a half-dozen [worshiped_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] turned, retreating back into [worshiped_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] lair."
 agot_filler_dragon.0011.desc.watch_ate: "My retinue and I sat back as we waited for [worshiped_dragon.GetFirstName] to exit [worshiped_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] lair. For a few minutes it seemed like nothing would happen, but sure enough eventually [worshiped_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] slowly came into view.\n\nEven from this distance, it was the closest I had been to [worshiped_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHim')]. The way the muscles rippled beneath scales, and the sheer scale of the creature itself, were both mesmerizing.\n\nIt seems, though, that my fears did not come to pass. Just as [worshiped_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] had done many times before, [worshiped_dragon.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] calmly wandered towards the offerings, and after letting out a jet of flame to cook them, began to feast."
 agot_filler_dragon.0011.desc.watch_attacked: "A dragon may not be a god, but on this night, [worshiped_dragon.GetFirstName] may as well have been.\n\nAt first there was silence, and then an ear-splitting roar. Before we could cover our ears, the roar of throat was replaced by a roar of flame. I watch in horror as a score of peasants are burned before my eyes in seconds, men, women, and children all engulfed in flame. The crowd immediately scatters, cries of terror briefly taking over the soundscape before again being replaced by a beat of wings and a torrent of dragonfire.\n\nWithout even waiting for the order, I feel my men grab me to flee, and as our horses beat a path back towards home, the cries of burning humanity haunt our hoofbeats."
 agot_filler_dragon.0011.desc.participate_ate: "I step forward and move towards the back of the line, wanting to remain respectful of this strange offering. The smallfolk around me look surprised, but pleased at my involvement, and keep a respectful distance in line. Eventually, it is my turn to place my offering on the table. I do so and with still no sign of [worshiped_dragon.GetFirstName], step into the crowd.\n\nA minute passes, then two, and the last offering is put on the table. Finally, a low rumble is heard, and the great form of [worshiped_dragon.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] walks towards our offerings. This close, I feel I could almost reach out and touch [worshiped_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHim')].\n\nI respectfully bow, slowly backing up as I watch the grand display."
 agot_filler_dragon.0011.desc.participate_attacked: "I am the last of the participants to line up, delayed as the decision was. As the line slowly moves forward I can feel the anticipation of seeing [worshiped_dragon.GetFirstName] closer than ever build.\n\nFinally, just as I am about to place my offering with the others, a low rumble is heard. Steps. A great shadow emerges from the darkness, glowing eyes belying a fierce inner fire standing against the black. As the massive form of [worshiped_dragon.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] rises before me I cannot help but kneel and offer my portion in supplication.\n\nI can feel the form of [worshiped_dragon.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] raising [worshiped_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] head over me to regard it before I feel the searing heat of dragonflame engulf the onlookers behind me! The last thing I hear is the horrified screams of the smallfolk around me, as I look up and see a great toothy maw descend..."

 agot_filler_dragon.0102.desc: "I am wandering through the grounds as a great shadow passes over me. I look up to see [dragonrider_in_court.GetFirstName] astride [dragon_of_courtier.GetFirstName], the two of them soaring through the sky. The wind in [dragonrider_in_court.GetHerHis] hair, the sun on [dragonrider_in_court.GetHerHis] face, the power of the beast beneath [dragonrider_in_court.GetHerHim].\n\nThe power, the grace, the beauty of it, and all under [dragonrider_in_court.GetHerHis] command. I cannot help but feel an acute pang in my loins as I watch [dragonrider_in_court.GetHerHim] fly!"

 agot_filler_dragon.0104.desc: "How long have I been here? Days? Months? I gradually lose track of time, but one thing remains despite everything: my bond with [dragon.GetName].\n\nEven here, even locked between these walls, deprived of the sensation of the wind on my face, I feel something. Something deep inside me. Though we are apart, I feel [dragon.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] so close.\n\nIn this moment the thought of no other gives me such a feeling of security and comfort. It's as if [dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHim')] is here — as if I could reach out and touch [dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] scales beneath my fingers..."
