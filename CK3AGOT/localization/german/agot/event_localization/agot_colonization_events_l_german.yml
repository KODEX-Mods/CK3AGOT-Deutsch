In the twilight light, we made camp on the edge of a copse of stout trees and set to work starting a campfire. Despite the lack of comfort, I feel a calmness descending on me as I take in the beauty of the star-studded sky.\n\nSuddenly, I hear a snarl. Across from the fire, I see a pair of eyes. Just as suddenly, the pair are joined by two dozen others, and I realize that we are surrounded. A cruel howl strikes our ears, and our error becomes clear — we have camped beside a wolf den!

As we approach, our fear grows, for the she-wolf stands before a scrabbling pile of wolf-cubs, and her snarl and snap make it clear that she means to defend them with all her strength and ferocity." #NT!

The settlers there have brought over many domestic dogs to their lands, who act as loyal and reliable guardians of livestock and households. However, this has had disturbing consequences. As the population of wolves diminishes and these domestic dogs roam the lands in larger numbers, a hybrid species has started to become more common as the wolves and hounds intermix.\n\nThese 'wolf-dogs' possess the characteristics of a wolf but the temperament of a dog, and have started to become quite popular among the local population as pets and guardians. But some voice worry that these hybrids might be too wild to truly tame, or that they might form wild packs of their own should the population boom out of control!" #NT!

The hunters I led into the wolf den of [obstacle_province.GetName] have been picked off one by one, and soon I am alone, facing off against the unnatural beast.\n\nIt is by far the largest wolf I have ever seen, and the disturbingly intelligent glint in its eyes promises a long, miserable death should I not flee its territory immediately." #NT!

The wolves, they say, are so numerous and terrible that merely surviving the nights is a challenge. The situation is unsustainable.\n\nAs my retinue and I prepare to return home to gather a force to cull the wolves, I get separated from the rest of my group with only a small handful of people. Before long, the quiet gloom of the night is shattered by the howls of what must be at least a hundred wolves.

A little extra caution is ordinarily all that is required, and even the more inquisitive beasts can usually be deterred by the vigorous clanging of cooking pans.\n\nOne bear is different. Known as 'Yoh-gi' in the local dialect, he is smarter than the average bear, stalking work parties and attacking them whenever they pause for a meal. As soon as the workers scatter, he raids their baggage for supplies, stealing any food they have brought with them.\n\nThere is considerable debate in the settlement as to how to deal with the problem. The colony has employed rangers, who wish to mount an expedition against the bear. However, the settlement's smith believes the bear can be lured into an ingenious trap of his own design, baited with a honey-laden beehive." #NT!

She rears on her hind legs and roars, but seems reluctant to charge and leave the shelter of her rocky recess. Taking this for a sign of weakness, I leap forward and plunge my spear into her chest. After a short struggle, the bear collapses, twitching. With her last strength, she looks into my eyes again with an expression that seems almost... pleading. Disconcerted, I step back and drop the spear.\n\nIt is then that I hear the mewling.\n\nAt the back of the cave, I find the source of the noise — a tiny cub, still blind and feeble, crawls towards me.
