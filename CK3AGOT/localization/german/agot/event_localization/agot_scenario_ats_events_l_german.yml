 agot_scenario_ats.1000.desc: "As I drift away to sleep at night, dreams haunt my silent hours. Dreams of my brothers, choking on their own lifeblood amidst a sea of crimson grass. How I saw a hammer shatter my father's army against a cold iron anvil. A brother's arrow finding the heart of a black dragon beneath a weeping ridge.\n\nThose visions proved terribly true, just as I know my new dreams will. Of late, I have seen a mighty dragon tearing free from its cold shell amidst a wedding feast. I have seen a giant, clad in glittering white plate with a matching cloak billowing behind them, stand beside a silver-haired king. I have agonized over every detail of these visions, every interpretation. I know now that the former shall be a dragon to claim my birthright, and the giant shall be the guardian who helps me keep it.\n\nThese dreams portend my kingship — the final proof that I am my father's son. Though before I prove it to the world, I must prove it to my uncle [bittercringe.GetNameNicknamed]." #NT!

Their Red Widow was a girl of ten when she lost her first husband, killed on the [Glossary( 'Redgrass Field', 'REDGRASS_FIELD_GLOSS' )]. I thought the losses might end then, but there were more. My son, my daughter, my father, and three more husbands have all gone.\n\nMy father left me Coldmoat, though he trapped me in a web when I reached to take it. I must wed before the moon turns, or my father's will passes my lands to a cousin. I see how Ser [longinch.GetFullNameNicknamed] looks at me with hungry eyes; [longinch.GetSheHe] would have my lands to [longinch.GetHerselfHimself], my wants be damned.\n\nAs if my father's will were not enough, nearby lords think that without a man at my side I am weak. What they do not know is that I no longer put my trust in men. I put my trust in stone, steel, and water. I put my trust in moats, and mine shall not go dry, drought or no.
