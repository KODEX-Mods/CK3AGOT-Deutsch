 agot_major_decisions_events.1003.desc: "Our generations-long dream to escape the harsh realities of life on the wrong side of the Wall is fulfilled. Would it not be a display of hubris to defiantly carry on as we were back there and disregard the laws and customs of our new neighbors? The folk on the southern side of the wall may be timid and soft, but their lives are long and comfortable. They clearly know how to make the most of this pleasant land and if their laws help them in this, then we shall adopt them as well."
