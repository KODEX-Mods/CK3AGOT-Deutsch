 fots_stars_adj: "Faith of the Stars" #NT!
 fots_stars_adherent: "Faithful" #NT!
 fots_stars_adherent_plural: "Faithful" #NT!
 fots_stars_desc: "It was to the Andals and their king, Hugor of the Hill, that the Seven-Who-Are-One revealed themselves. They taught the Andals how to work iron, gave them the rites of Knighthood, and tasked them with conquering the sunset lands of Westeros." #NT!
  
 #The FAITH 
 fots_seven: "Faith of the Seven" #NT!
 fots_seven_adj: "Faith of the Seven" #NT!
 fots_seven_adherent: "Faithful" #NT!
 fots_seven_adherent_plural: "Faithful" #NT!
 fots_seven_desc: "The Faith of the Seven is the dominant religion of Westeros. The majority of the people and lands are counted among the Faithful, and all the Kings of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men, in addition to being members, have sought crowning by the High Septon. The Faith is built upon the revelations and truths as laid out in The Seven-Pointed Star and is led by the guidance of the Most Devout and the High Septon." #NT!

 fots_blessed_adherent: "Faithful" #NT!
 fots_blessed_adherent_plural: "Faithful" #NT!
 fots_blessed_desc: "Baelor the Blessed was the most devout man to ever sit the Iron Throne. It was he who commissioned the Great Sept as a new seat for the High Septon and who led the realm to its most faithful ways. Those who follow in his footsteps would see his great works continue in the name of the Seven." #NT!
  
 #Sword Faith 
 fots_sword: "Faith of the Sword" #NT!
 fots_sword_adj: "Faith of the Sword" #NT!
 fots_sword_adherent: "Faithful" #NT!
 fots_sword_adherent_plural: "Faithful" #NT!
 fots_sword_desc: "When the Andals came to Westeros, they came with fire and iron, with sword and star. Since then, the Faithful have been misled, as the High Septon and the Most Devout now bow to political and foreign pressures. It will only be through the Sword that the Faith will earn the favor of the Seven once again." #NT!
  
 #Pure Faith

 fots_pure_adj: "Faith of the Pure" #NT!
 fots_pure_adherent: "Faithful" #NT!
 fots_pure_adherent_plural: "Faithful" #NT!
 fots_pure_desc: "The presence of the Old Gods and the Drowned God has tainted the Faithful. For when the Father spoke to Hugor upon the Hill, did he not say that the lands of Westeros were for the Andals and the Faithful alone? Only by rejecting the contamination of these heresies and blasphemies can the Faithful achieve what the Seven had planned for them." #NT!

 fots_oldnew_desc: "Long before the Andals came, the Old Gods and their Weirwoods were here. Yet, the Old and New Gods are not opposed, nor are they separate gods.

 fots_sands_adj: "Faith of the Sands" #NT!
 fots_sands_adherent: "Faithful" #NT!
 fots_sands_adherent_plural: "Faithful" #NT!
 fots_sands_desc: "Dorne has always been unique in its relations with outside groups, and the Faith is no different. While nearly all Dornish are of the Faithful, barring the Orphans, they have never bowed to the rules and regulations of the Most Devout or High Septon like the rest. They worship the Seven, yet they will not discard their way of life, the Dornish way of life, just because a Reachman High Septon says. And thus, the Dornish have broken from the Most Devout and will follow the Seven-Who-Are-One in their own way." #NT!
