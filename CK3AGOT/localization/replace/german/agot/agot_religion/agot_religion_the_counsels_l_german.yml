 dothraki_faith_desc: "The religion and beliefs of the Dothraki are largely derived from their ancient traditions and the teachings of the witch-queen Doshi, mother of the first great Khal. Most of the natural world is represented by many gods: the Sun and his wife, the Moon; the earth itself; and above all, the Great Stallion. While they acknowledge the gods of other lands and peoples, they are not to be worshipped. Instead, they are to be broken and dragged to Vaes Dothrak to become vanquished witnesses to the greatness of the Dothraki and their gods." #NT!
