 free_city_events.9999.desc_old_holder: "So, it’s done. I’ve been replaced. \n\n[magister_winner.GetFullName] is the new First Magister, and I—well, I step aside for now. The Magisters and the Gonfaloniere have sworn their fealty to the new leader, their voices echoing in the hall with promises I once commanded. \n\nIt’s hard to swallow, but I’ve been here before. Power slips through fingers like sand, but I know the game isn’t over. I won’t be forgotten. I mustn't be." #NT!

But what now? How will I rule? Already, some Magisters plot openly, while others whisper sweet words to my face, all the while trying to pick my pocket. I must remain vigilant and ready to face whatever comes next." #NT!

With much ceremony, the Magisters and the Gonfaloniere swear their allegiance to the new First Magister, and [magister_winner.GetHerHis] authority is officially acknowledged by the people. \n\nHow [magister_winner.GetFullNameNoTooltip] will rule remains uncertain, and already the Magisters plot on how to sway their new leader to their side." #NT!

 free_city_events.1001.desc_elector: "With the realm embroiled in a war against the [war_enemy.GetPrimaryTitle.GetName], the Conclave has deemed it unsafe to proceed with the election of a new First Magister.\n\nInstead, the [current_ruler.GetFullNameNicknamed] has temporarily assumed new powers to help maintain order and stability until the war ends.\n\nThe Conclave and the Gonfaloniere declare in an announcement that they acknowledge the First Magister's authority during this period of crisis, aware that their city's future hangs in the balance. The citizens now sit awaiting the end of the conflict, seemingly divided, either cheering on the decrees or uncertain what lies ahead once peace is restored." #NT!

 free_city_events.1002.desc_liege: "With the war concluded, the question of relinquishing the emergency powers assumed during the conflict looms large. \n\nThe Conclave is preparing to resume the election of a new First Magister, but the process is uncertain. [magister_winner.GetFullName] appears to be a likely candidate, but the final decision has yet to be made. \n\nAs the Magister who maintained stability through the war, you contemplate whether stepping down is truly in the city's best interest, or well, your best interest, or if your continued leadership could provide the guidance needed in these precarious times." #NT!

A memory of those days, when our cities were united and strong has been brought to our hearts once more.\n\n[request_sender.GetSheHe|U] once again wishes to raise the banner of the Kingdom of the Three Daughters, uniting Myr, Lys, and Tyrosh in purpose and power.\n\nWill we, as proud and sovereign cities, reject the animosity of the past and reform an eternal alliance from the days long gone? Will we stand together, shoulder to shoulder, and face the coming storms as a united Triarchy — or will we choose to follow our destiny as individual ships, facing the storms alone?" #NT!

 free_city_events.0004.desc: "It is with heavy hearts that we must accept the failure of [request_sender.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] attempt to reform the alliance between the Three Daughters. Despite the noble cause, the Triarchy shall not be lifted up at this point in history. Yet one day, the idea may rise again from the ashes.\n\nThe dream of a united realm, where Myr, Lys, and Tyrosh stand shoulder to shoulder, reclaiming their rightful lands, and repelling their foes back, remains distant. For now, those three cities stand apart, each pursuing its own path.\n\nIf only had the stars aligned differently, the known world would bend from our strength..." #NT!
