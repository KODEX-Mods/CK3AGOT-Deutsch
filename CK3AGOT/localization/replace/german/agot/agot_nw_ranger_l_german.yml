There, my comrades helped patch up the wound, ensuring I could recover from both the beast's attack and my narrow escape." #NT!
 agot_nw_ranger_events.1104.desc.three.c: "The wildling and beast clashed violently, allowing me to sneak away, unseen, as their fight consumed them both.\n\nBy the time I reached the other rangers, I was already losing blood, but they acted quickly to mend my injury. I had escaped the wildling and beast, but not without a reminder of the close call." #NT!

 agot_nw_ranger_events.2306.t: "What Remains in the Snow" #NT!
 agot_nw_ranger_events.2306.artifact.desc: "The truth of the ranger's death remains elusive. No tracks lead me to a killer, no signs reveal their identity.\n\nAs I scour the area one last time, my hand brushes against something beneath the snow — a weapon, old yet serviceable. It may not answer my questions, but it is still of use." #NT!
 agot_nw_ranger_events.2306.gold.desc: "The wind howls through the trees, as if mocking my failure. Whoever — or whatever — killed the ranger left no clear trail behind.\n\nAs I turn to leave, something glints in the frost. Gold. Not much, but enough to make me wonder — was this a ranger's coin purse? Or did someone leave it behind in a hurry?" #NT!
 agot_nw_ranger_events.2306.food.desc: "The wilds give no easy answers. No sign of the ranger's killer remains, no hidden truths buried beneath the ice.\n\nAs I search the area, I find something unexpected — bundled provisions, half-buried in the snow. Whether they belonged to the fallen ranger or someone else, they will not go to waste." #NT!
 agot_nw_ranger_events.2306.nothing.desc: "I have combed every inch of the area, but no answers reveal themselves. No tracks, no clues—only the cold, endless white.\n\nWhoever killed the ranger is long gone, and I leave with nothing but questions." #NT!
 agot_nw_ranger_events.2306.a: "I should report my findings to the Lord Commander." #NT!
