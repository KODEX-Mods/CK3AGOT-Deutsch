 agot_bm_8259_desc: "Die Schar der Neun, eine Gruppe ehrgeiziger Machthungrige in Essos, haben die Streitenden Länder und die Trittsteine erobert. Sie setzten Alequo Adarys die Silberzunge als Herrscher von Tyrosh ein. Nun hat Maelys I. Schwarzfeuer, die letzte der Schwarzfeuer-Prätendenten und Anführerin der Goldenen Kompanie, sie davon überzeugt, Westeros anzugreifen und den Eisernen Thron zu besteigen. König Aegon V. Targaryen hat jedoch von diesem Plan erfahren und plant, eine Armee zu den Trittsteinen zu schicken, um sich dieser Bedrohung zu stellen, bevor eine weitere Schwarzfeuer-Invasion das Reich verwüsten kann."

To gain control of the Golden Company, he killed a war horse with a single punch and pulled his cousin Daemon’s head from his body. Now, surrounded by nefarious supporters, he may just have the strength to fulfill the destiny of the Black Dragon.\n\n#bold Brute strength may win battles, but will Maelys have the cunning and tact to take the Seven Kingdoms for his own?#!" #NT!

Such was the case with his love for his sister, the Princess Shaera.
