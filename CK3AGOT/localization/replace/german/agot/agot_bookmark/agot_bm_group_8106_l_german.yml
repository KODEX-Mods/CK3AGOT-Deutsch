 agot_bm_8106_desc: "In den Freien Städten beanspruchten die Triarchen von Volantis, die wahren Nachfahren des alten Valyria zu sein, was ihrer Stadt einen höheren Status als den anderen ehemaligen Kolonien des Valyrischen Freistaats verlieh. Nach jahrelanger erbitterter Rivalität zwischen Lys und Myr, beschlossen sie diese beiseite zu legen. Gemeinsam mit Tyrosh begannen sie im Jahr 96 n.A.E. sie Krieg gegen das mächtige Volantis, in der Hoffnung ein neues unaufhaltsames Bündnis zu gründen."

Believing he would be heir, he was a brash supporter of his brother, King Viserys I, in the Great Council — even raising an army in his brother’s name. However, with Rhaenyra named heir and Viserys married once more, Daemon sees his chance at the throne crumbling. He is now determined to carve out his own kingdom, and astride the dragon Caraxes, he flies alongside the Velaryon fleet to destroy the Triarchy’s hold on the Stepstones.\n\n#bold Will this rogue prince have his kingdom, or will the fire and death he brings come to him instead?#!" #NT!

His refusal to name Daemon as his heir has led his brother to ally himself with Lord Corlys Velaryon to carve out his own kingdom in the Stepstones. Though breaking the Triarchy’s hold on those trade routes would be a boon to Westeros, Viserys must balance his love for his brother — and his desire to see him succeed — with the threat that another Targaryen ruler would pose.\n\n#bold Will Viserys thread the needle of his brother’s ambition and the stranglehold of the Three Daughters?#!" #NT!

The wealth that Corlys has spent a lifetime building is now under threat from the Triarchy’s trade restrictions. He has allied himself with Prince Daemon Targaryen, and together they are determined to break the Triarchy and restore the trade routes through the Stepstones under a new king.\n\n#bold This latest of the Sea Snake’s voyages may prove his most perilous — as he defies his king, allies with a dragon, and sails against an empire.#!" #NT!

Craghas found success with his brutal method of feeding the pirate lords to the crabs of the island, and now grows wealthy off the steep tolls levied on passing ships. However, a new challenger sails — and flies — from the north that seeks to upset this balance.
