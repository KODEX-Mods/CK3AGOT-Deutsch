 agot_bm_8233_desc: "After a hundred years of decline and three failed attempts to sit a Blackfyre pretender on the Iron Throne, House Peake has risen once more in rebellion against the line of Daeron ‘the Good.’\n\nDespite his age, King Maekar I Targaryen remains a mighty warrior and personally leads a host of Crownlanders and Westermen to crush the petty, doomed uprising. After every other challenge Maekar has faced in his near sixty years, surely #italic this#! will be the easiest.\n\n#bold Shall the Peakes succeed against all odds, or will the once-proud dynasty slide further into obscurity?#!" #NT!

Since the Second Blackfyre Rebellion, never has a revolt been so meek as Lord Estyn Peake’s feckless uprising. Though the kin who had once helped him are now lost to time, it should be little trouble for ‘the Anvil’ to crush these foes.\n\n#bold Aged and tired, can Maekar fulfill his duty and secure the future of House Targaryen one last time?#!" #NT!

However, sickness and strife has claimed them all. Following the foolhardy death of Aegon’s elder brother Aerion, King Maekar I has failed to name a new Prince of Dragonstone — and heir. Yet already whispers claim that this son will sit the throne when his father’s days are done.\n\n#bold How will Aegon handle life as the last unbound adult male of the House of the dragon besides the king himself?#!" #NT!

But how the mighty have fallen. House Peake has suffered tragedy after tragedy since Lord Unwin ruled in King’s Landing. Thrice the Peakes rose with the Black Dragon, and thrice they were cast down by Daeron the Falseborn and his sons. Loyalty has cost them much.\n\n#bold Can Estyn restore his House to the heights it saw under his ancestors, or is House Peake doomed to fall even further?#!" #NT!
