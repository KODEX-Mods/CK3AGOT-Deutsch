 coronation_banquet.0801.desc.greedy: "\n\nAt a feast, everyone's a little greedy for something — truthfully it's relaxing to see the world be so #EMP honest#! for a change." #NT!
 coronation_banquet.0801.desc.generous: "\n\nThere's something so simply pleasant about the act of feeding others, of all breaking bread and sharing cups in the same room." #NT!
 coronation_banquet.0801.desc.lazy: "And me? I don't have to move a muscle. People, food, drink, cushions, servants, they all come to me without my having to lift a finger. #EMP Perfection#!." #NT!

 coronation_banquet.0801.desc.calm: "\n\nSome people think a banquet is a hectic place, but to me, they're a bastion of calm and social accord. Everyone sits easier with a full belly and a sloshing cup, after all." #NT!
 coronation_banquet.0801.desc.patient: "\n\nI even enjoy the waits between courses — they're not just chances to laugh and chat, they let you reflect on the dish you ate and the thought that went into it." #NT!
 coronation_banquet.0801.desc.impatient: "\n\nA solid banquet is one of the few environments where you rarely have to wait for anything. Want food? It's there. Need a drink? They'll pour you one. Fancy a chat? Good company is everywhere. Bliss." #NT!
 coronation_banquet.0801.desc.arrogant: "\n\nIt does me good to hobnob with some of my lessers like this, my [ROOT.Char.Custom('FootFeet')] up on a stool, spreading my goodwill amongst the masses of petty nobles." #NT!
 coronation_banquet.0801.desc.humble: "So many people, come from all over the realm, just to be here. It really gives some perspective on how vast the world is." #NT!
 coronation_banquet.0801.desc.deceitful: "\n\nI've started a few rumors amongst the throng already, just as a bit of fun. I find it rather sporting to see just how fast a lie can spread, even without any further motive than causing a little chaos." #NT!

 coronation_banquet.0801.desc.gregarious: "\n\nIt's a shame we couldn't get more guests, just another tableful or so, but not everyone has the party spirit. Not everyone, perhaps, but #EMP I#! do, and I'm as good as a table or two all by myself!" #NT!
 coronation_banquet.0801.desc.ambitious: "So much opportunity to talk, to meet, to discuss, to plan. Each new conversation is the seed of a new goal, each dish an excuse to add another contact." #NT!
 coronation_banquet.0801.desc.content: "I can't think of a single thing I'd change. It's all just... perfect." #NT!
 coronation_banquet.0801.desc.arbitrary: "\n\nOf course, not everything's quite how I'd like it, but that's the nature of these gatherings. Next time things'll be different, and the spice of change gives something to look forward to." #NT!
 coronation_banquet.0801.desc.just: "\n\nI've always found the natural order of a banquet delightful to behold. Tables neatly laid out, social ranks quietly enforced, everyone happy and laughing and in their proper place. Exactly where they should be." #NT!
 coronation_banquet.0801.desc.cynical: "Of course, most of them are just here to eat and drink on someone else's coin, but who am I to judge? It's hardly a choice I can blame them for, and the food is #EMP delicious#!." #NT!
 coronation_banquet.0801.desc.zealous: "\n\nI mumble a quick devotion to [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HealthGodName], giving thanks for the next wonderful course on its way.

 coronation_banquet.0801.desc.paranoid: "\n\nI am constantly alert for any hint of danger, deliberate or accidental, planned or impromptu. There's just enough to match my expectations — not so much that a plot is obvious, not so little that a plot is clearly disguised. Just the way I like it." #NT!
 coronation_banquet.0801.desc.trusting: "\n\nOf course, with everyone in such good cheer and so much gorgeous food to try, who could bring ill will to such a gathering? No, this is a joyous affair, and I'm joyous with it." #NT!

 coronation_banquet.0801.desc.callous: "\n\nNot that I would be #EMP overly#! bothered if the rest of them were having a poor time, but I can still appreciate a pleasant atmosphere. In moderation." #NT!
 coronation_banquet.0801.desc.sadistic: "I enjoy screams and sobs as much as the next well-adjusted [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip], but cries of merriment can certainly make a nice change of pace." #NT!
 coronation_banquet.0801.desc.stubborn: "I've considered getting up to meander around like so many others, but that would mean giving up my seat, and I'll be damned if I yield it." #NT!
 coronation_banquet.0801.desc.fickle: "I think my favorite thing about banquests #EMP has#! to be the food. No, the people. Actually, perhaps the drinks? Or the entertainment, or..." #NT!
 coronation_banquet.0801.desc.vengeful: "\n\nNaturally, no small amount of it is directed at the server I've just tripped, now covered in slimy appetisers. Serves the bastard right for forgetting to top up my drink last course." #NT!
 coronation_banquet.0801.desc.forgiving: "\n\nI'm a little worried that the serving staff missed my goblet when last they came round, but there's always next course. In fact, that's one of the lovely things about a banquet — there's #EMP always#! a next course." #NT!
 coronation_banquet.0801.desc.outro: "\n\nSometimes it's nice to simply sit back and enjoy the little things in life." #NT!
