Panic grips me as the once clear words now twist themselves into illegible shapes. \n\nI blinked hard, hoping it was a momentary lapse.

 agot_health_events.1001.desc: "My heart races as darkness creeps into the periphery of my left eye, spreading like ink on wet paper as the days go on. While the sight in my right eye is weaker, yet no less still present, my left eye continues to succumb to a stubborn haze.\n\nI rub it frantically, but it's no use. The blurring intensifies, and soon, all vision from my left eye is gone.\n\nI am blind in one eye, half my world now veiled in darkness. Fear tightens its grip on me as I grapple with this sudden, terrifying change." #NT!

 agot_health_events.1002.desc: "Since losing half of my sight, I have learned to rely more on my remaining sight, however weak it is, finding new ways to adapt. But the fear never leaves me as my remaining vision blurs more and more by the day. \n\nOne morning, I wake up to find that all remaining sight in my right eye is gone! Panic rises as I find my world has at last dimmed to complete darkness.\n\nI am blind.\n\nMy heart races, but now I must confront a new, more daunting challenge: navigating a world entirely without sight. Fear grips me, but I must find the strength to adapt once more." #NT!

 agot_health_events.1003.desc: "My heart races, a cold sweat forming on my brow. Each attempt to focus only makes the world fuzzier. I rub my eyes, but it's no use. The vibrant colors of the room have begun to fade into a murky grey, and shadows creep into the edges of my vision.\n\nThe realization hits me like a blow — I am losing my sight.\n\nFear tightens its grip as I struggle to make sense of my surroundings. The truth is undeniable now; Age has begun to steal my sight, and darkness slowly closes in, enveloping me into an inescapable void." #NT!

 agot_health_events.1004.desc: "I spend the next few days in a haze, my world reduced to shadows and vague outlines. Each day feels eternal, my senses heightened to compensate for my lost vision.\n\nThen, one morning, I wake up and blink into the sunlight streaming through the window. The room sharpens into focus, details crystallizing before my eyes. Relief floods over me as I take in the familiar surroundings.\n\nMy sight has returned, as suddenly as it had vanished, leaving me with a newfound appreciation for the gift of vision." #NT!
 agot_health_events.1004.a: "The world is a wonderful carousel of color." #NT!
