The conquest of the Seven Kingdoms remains one of the greatest feats achieved within one lifespan. I cannot help but ponder the impact of [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('Targaryen_27').GetFirstNamePossessive] Conquest on our realm. The legacy of the [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('Targaryen_27').GetHouse.GetName] dynasty is undeniable, and its foundations were drawn from that one man's actions.\n\n" #NT!
 agot_historical_inspiration.0001.nontarg: "A part of me acknowledges the benefits that have come with Targaryen rule. Stability, centralized power, and the protection of the dragons are not things to be taken lightly. Yet, I also wonder what would have happened had Aegon not crossed from Dragonstone. Would Westeros still be divided to this day? Would a Westerosi have broken the stalemate? Could peace have been achieved without blood and fire?\n\nThe legacy of the Conquest will be debated for centuries to come, but it is for me to decide what I can take away from it." #NT!

The shadow of a Lannister standard flowing in the wind briefly shields my eyes, and a thought comes to my head. [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('Lannister_29').GetFirstNameNicknamed]. The mythical scion of my [house|E]. Did he truly have the Casterlys out of Casterly Rock devoured by a pride of lions to give us our sigil? The story has many tellings. Did he manipulate the Casterlys into killing each other? Sleep with all their women in the dead of night? Drive them out with rats instead?\n\nWhile the maesters dispute all of these, saying he is nothing but a figure of myth and legend, it is a legend that I have been told I am descended from since I was a babe." #NT!

While the maesters dispute his existence, saying he is nothing but a figure of myth and legend, there was a man who must have mastered his wit. Though not known to be a poet, tricking the Casterlys out of one of the greatest seats in the land must be one of the most cunning feats committed in Westeros.

In my darker moments I may even believe them...\n\nThe disquieting thought does not leave me even as I lay abed, eyes locked to the dark ceiling. Yet in the darkness, a comforting thought arises. Bastards have achieved greatness before. [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('Lannister_29').GetFirstNameNicknamed], the mythical founder of House Lannister, is said to have been a bastard in some tellings of the story.
