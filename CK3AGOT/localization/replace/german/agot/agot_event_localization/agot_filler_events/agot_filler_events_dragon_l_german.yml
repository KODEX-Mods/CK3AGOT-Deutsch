I am told that a massive mob, numbering in the thousands at least, has stormed the dragonpit!\n\nHundreds now lay dead, most from the dragons held within, and many more when the dome was brought down on top of them! The rubbled remains are now naught but a scene of blood and charred bones. " #NT!

 agot_filler_dragon.0011.desc.massacre: "It was a slaughter.\n\nThe peasantry, drunk on religious fervor, ale, and whatever else their strange practices held sacred, did not even see the mounting attack from behind. The unarmored and unarmed men were slaughtered before they could even form a defensive line. What little resistance they did offer was crushed. The men died, the women and children either met the same fate or fled back to their homes.\n\nOnce [worshiped_dragon.GetFirstName] wandered into the feast, far more than simple meats awaited [worshiped_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHim')]. Even after [worshiped_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] cooked the bodies in dragonfire, it seems there were more to feast on than [worshiped_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] could enjoy.

For a few minutes it seemed like nothing would happen, but sure enough eventually [worshiped_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] slowly came into view.\n\nEven from this distance, it was the closest I had been to [worshiped_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHim')]. The way the muscles rippled beneath scales, and the sheer scale of the creature itself, were both mesmerizing.\n\nIt seems, though, that my fears did not come to pass. Just as [worshiped_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] had done many times before, [worshiped_dragon.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] calmly wandered towards the offerings, and after letting out a jet of flame to cook them, began to feast." #NT!
 agot_filler_dragon.0011.desc.watch_attacked: "A dragon may not be a god, but on this night, [worshiped_dragon.GetFirstName] may as well have been.\n\nAt first there was silence, and then an ear-splitting roar. Before we could cover our ears, the roar of throat was replaced by a roar of flame. I watch in horror as a score of peasants are burned before my eyes in seconds, men, women, and children all engulfed in flame. The crowd immediately scatters, cries of terror briefly taking over the soundscape before again being replaced by a beat of wings and a torrent of dragonfire.\n\nWithout even waiting for the order, I feel my men grab me to flee, and as our horses beat a path back towards home, the cries of burning humanity haunt our hoofbeats." #NT!
 agot_filler_dragon.0011.desc.participate_ate: "I step forward and move towards the back of the line, wanting to remain respectful of this strange offering. The smallfolk around me look surprised, but pleased at my involvement, and keep a respectful distance in line. Eventually, it is my turn to place my offering on the table. I do so and with still no sign of [worshiped_dragon.GetFirstName], step into the crowd.\n\nA minute passes, then two, and the last offering is put on the table. Finally, a low rumble is heard, and the great form of [worshiped_dragon.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] walks towards our offerings.

Steps. A great shadow emerges from the darkness, glowing eyes belying a fierce inner fire standing against the black. As the massive form of [worshiped_dragon.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] rises before me I cannot help but kneel and offer my portion in supplication.\n\nI can feel the form of [worshiped_dragon.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] raising [worshiped_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] head over me to regard it before I feel the searing heat of dragonflame engulf the onlookers behind me!
