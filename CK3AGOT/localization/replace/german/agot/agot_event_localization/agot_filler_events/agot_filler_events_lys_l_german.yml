A salty ocean breeze, warmed by the kiss of the Summer Sea sun and carrying citrusy scents, cradles me as I pass by perfumed gardens, pleasure houses beyond count, and sprawling private palaces.\n\nAll of this is the property of merchant princes and their competitors who rule the free city just as the lords of the Seven Kingdoms rule their inheritance. As my journey reaches its end I stand before the mountainous Temple of Trade at the heart of the city. It is a monument of undeniable majesty dedicated to the only god that matters in Lys: #bold the god of gold#!." #NT!

As the maven opens the door to greet me, the brutes nod and wave me past to follow [market_merchant.GetHerHim] into a stunning foyer with a view to the second story.\n\nBooks of a certain age carry a distinct smell, and if my nose can be trusted this place must be filled with ancient knowledge.
