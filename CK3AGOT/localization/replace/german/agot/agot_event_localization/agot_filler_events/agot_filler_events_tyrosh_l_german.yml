  # Dye Merchants Hound You # 
  
 agot_filler_tyrosh.0001.t: "The Hounds of Tyrosh" #NT!
 agot_filler_tyrosh.0001.desc: "Some business in the city causes me to pass through a thriving dye market. I brace myself as I enter the cramped square to the baying of dye merchants and the barking of their servants. They swirl about me in the usual dance — each one vying for a crumb of attention from the master's table. If I tell them I'm not interested they begin crying out every kind of relation and acquaintance for whom I could possibly purchase a dye!\n\nThese hounds understand mine might be the fattest purse they'll see for some time, and they refuse to give up the chase until I've escaped their noisy kennel... but perhaps I'm being hasty? After all it #italic is#! the height of fashion in Tyrosh! Peoples in other Free Cities and certainly other realms may not understand the tradition, but the Tyroshi have a proud history of providing the most sought-after dyes of the Valyrian Freehold." #NT!
 agot_filler_tyrosh.0001.a: "I'll take the green dye!" #NT!
 agot_filler_tyrosh.0001.b: "I'll take the purple dye!" #NT!
 agot_filler_tyrosh.0001.c: "I'll take the vermilion dye!" #NT!

  # Competing Inventors # 
  
 agot_filler_tyrosh.0002.t: "A Vision for the Future" #NT!
 agot_filler_tyrosh.0002.desc: "Two petitioners stand waiting before me. The blue-maned [torturer_inventor.GetName] appears eager to make [torturer_inventor.GetHerHis] proposition. While [construction_inventor.GetName] seems to be preoccupied with worries, bearing deep circles beneath [construction_inventor.GetHerHis] eyes that speak of sleepless nights, so I gesture for [torturer_inventor.GetNameNoTooltip] to begin.\n\n"[ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] your realm is infested with all manner of unruly knaves. I endeavour to perfect the ancient art of instilling fear in those women born in order to keep the peace, maintain order, and extract confessions from traitors. I believe the [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] would be well served by investing in my project," [torturer_inventor.GetSheHe] says.\n\nWithout prompt, the preoccupied petitioner begins to speak as if woken from a trance. "Yes, that all sounds well and good, [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip], but men forget other men. They cannot forget the mighty works they pass by every day: The Fountain of the Drunken God, the Temple of Trios, the Bleeding Tower, everything the Freehold built! This is what men see and remember. What they secretly worship as they go about their lives in the shadows of the works of their fathers' hands. And it is rulers with vision that make such worship possible," [construction_inventor.GetNameNoTooltip] concludes.\n\nInvesting in this torturer could mean a significant expansion to any enterprise in espionage, yet I cannot deny the truth which the architect has spoken. Each is desperate for my patronage but which is more worthy? More importantly what #italic is#! the state of my treasury?" #NT!
 agot_filler_tyrosh.0002.a: "My rule #italic will#! be secure. Whatever the cost." #NT!
 agot_filler_tyrosh.0002.b: "I want all Tyroshi to look upon my works and worship." #NT!
 agot_filler_tyrosh.0002.c: "Are there any beautiful petitioners? Move them to the front." #NT!
  
  # Ship Leaves Tyroshi Port Event # 
  
 agot_filler_tyrosh.0003.t: "Cargo for the Madame?" #NT!
 agot_filler_tyrosh.0003.desc: "As I pace the harbor early in the morning, I hear an old sea shanty dedicated to the Drunken God. Curious, I look to see a barnacled carrack hoist her sails with all the grace of a twice-drunk madame and stumble off her mooring as the crew forgot to release all the lines in their haste to sing and set sail.\n\nAs I watch her merrily waddle out to sea, occasionally cooled by the same gusts of wind that drive that grand old lady onward, I ask myself what kind of cargo would befit the haulage of such a salty sea dame?" #NT!
 agot_filler_tyrosh.0003.a: "Slaves must be the cargo." #NT!
 agot_filler_tyrosh.0003.b: "Dyes must be the cargo." #NT!
 agot_filler_tyrosh.0003.c: "I guess I'll never really know." #NT!
  
  # Honey Fingers Event # 
  
 agot_filler_tyrosh.0004.t: "All of The Honeyfingers" #NT!
 agot_filler_tyrosh.0004.desc: "At a certain point in the day, the shadow of my palace falls directly onto a narrow baker's street. On it lives one baker in particular who creates a delicate, hollow, and sweet pastry filled with a whipped and frothy honey-cream all fried in aromatic citrus seed oil.\n\nThe baker beams as I approach, and I can see why. Though the street is cramped, it is full of men, women, and children — all enjoying these honeyfingers in ecstatic silence. There are servants of merchant princes and lords of far-off lands questing to acquire honeyfingers for masters whom have only heard #italic rumors#! of their perfection!\n\nThe baker approaches and offers me a morsel, assuring me that it is his gift. It's warm in my hand and smells sweetly of nectarine and lemon. I take a bite to feel the sweet rush of honey-cream and the dainty crunch of the pastry mix on my tongue. So sweet and rich, yet #italic so#! light! I want to devour a thousand and make this one last forever all at once! Some crumbs and droplets of cream fall onto my clothes, but I can't be bothered in the midst of this bliss!\n\nI look about to see the reactions of others. Amazing that something so simple could bring peace to a baker's street." #NT!
 agot_filler_tyrosh.0004.a: "I'll buy a boxful." #NT!
 agot_filler_tyrosh.0004.b: "Why not the entire day's stock of honeyfingers?" #NT!
 agot_filler_tyrosh.0004.c: "This baker ought to be in my employ!" #NT!
 agot_filler_tyrosh.0004.d: "I #italic must#! resist temptation." #NT!
  
  # Stolen Ornate Helmet # 
  
 agot_filler_tyrosh.0005.t: "The Alleyway Not Taken..." #NT!
 agot_filler_tyrosh.0005.desc: "My daily laborings bring me to a street adjacent an alley, wherein I hear a most peculiar conversation. Two streets rats have almost come to blows as each bellows of his right to their day's work of thieving! The vile pair are arguing over a rather fine helm in the ornate Tyroshi style shaped into into a tiger's head and chased in platinum.\n\nTheir heated argument gives me the perfect opportunity to take them unawares and box them about the ears if I wished. Perhaps they only need a word of wisdom from their better? Though this #italic is#! beneath my station..." #NT!
 agot_filler_tyrosh.0005.a: "These boys must return the helmet." #NT!
 agot_filler_tyrosh.0005.b: "Perhaps they can split their profits..." #NT!
 agot_filler_tyrosh.0005.c: "GUARDS!" #NT!
 agot_filler_tyrosh.0005.d: "Some things are best left unnoticed." #NT!
  
  # (Don't Cry Over) Spilt Pear Brandy # 
  
 agot_filler_tyrosh.0006.t: "Don't Cry over Spilled Pear Brandy" #NT!
 agot_filler_tyrosh.0006.slavery_desc: "Passing by a tavern on my daily constitutional through Tyrosh I overhear a particularly truculent overseer lashing some poor slave in word and deed to a kind of executioner's rhythm.\n\n"How dare you #bold scum#!! This pear brandy is older than you and your mother and your whore of a grandmother! It was a gift to our master given to him by the old Archon's #bold own hand#!! #S And#! you had the gall not only to #italic drink#! from it with your wretched, unworthy lips but to #S SMASH#! the priceless amphora once caught!"\n\nThe overseer is a frothing mess barely coherent as [overseer.GetSheHe] continues the public spectacle for everyone within earshot of the street or any who can lean out of a window to watch. The slave says nothing making barely a whimper as [slave.GetHerHis] back is transformed by the torturer's craft into a dripping and frayed patchwork all in red." #NT!
 agot_filler_tyrosh.0006.no_slavery_desc: "Passing by a tavern on my daily constitutional through Tyrosh I overhear a particularly truculent overseer lashing some poor servant in word and deed to a kind of executioner's rhythm.\n\n"How dare you #bold scum#!! This pear brandy is older than you and your mother and your whore of a grandmother! It was a gift to our master given to him by the old Archon's #bold own hand#!! #S And#! you had the gall not only to #italic drink#! from it with your wretched, unworthy lips but to #S SMASH#! the priceless amphora once caught!"\n\nThe overseer is a frothing mess barely coherent as [overseer.GetSheHe] continues the public spectacle for every Tyroshi within earshot of the street or any who can lean out of a window to watch. The servant says nothing making barely a whimper as [slave.GetHerHis] back is transformed by the torturer's craft into a dripping and frayed patchwork all in red." #NT!
 agot_filler_tyrosh.0006.a: "This isn't my problem." #NT!
 agot_filler_tyrosh.0006.b: "Surely it wasn't [slave.GetHerHis] fault." #NT!
 agot_filler_tyrosh.0006.c: "I'm certain it was [slave.GetHerHis] fault." #NT!
  
  # Snail Breeding Industry Suffers # 
  
 agot_filler_tyrosh.0007.t: "Snail Breeders Under Siege!" #NT!
 agot_filler_tyrosh.0007.desc: "As the snail breeders file into my hall the pervasive stench of dead fish inevitably follows and begins to fill the chamber with an unseen cloud of a thousand rotten snail carcasses. I gesture for a sweet smelling handkerchief and bid their representative to begin with all haste.\n\n"[ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip], some of the smallfolk in your realm do not understand how vital our industry is to its wealth and glory. We are beset daily by mobs of gutter trash that complain of the smell which is an unavoidable aspect of our work!" The breeder continues to plead as I pinch my nose tightly closed. "They have gone so far as to foul the water of the ponds where we breed the snails necessary to make dyes! Too many of them have been rendered worthless with disease. It is no overstatement to say the very fate of Tyrosh is in your hands, and we humbly throw ourselves at your feet begging for your generosity."\n\nI wonder why I bother collecting taxes while stifling a yawn. For all that these snail breeders mewl about the baseness of smallfolk they seem no less petty. But though they gild the lily perhaps overmuch, they are right to say disruptions in the dye trade will have repercussions throughout the city. Perhaps I #italic should#! intervene... yet some say chaos is a ladder..." #NT!
 agot_filler_tyrosh.0007.a: "I'll grant the snail breeders relief." #NT!
 agot_filler_tyrosh.0007.b: "They really should have been more careful..." #NT!
  
  # Tyroshi Merchant Conversation # 
  
 agot_filler_tyrosh.0008.t: "Money Talks" #NT!
 agot_filler_tyrosh.0008.desc: "Gathered in my favorite pleasure house with the leading merchants and nobles of the realm we eat and drink our fill and argue over which industry is the cornerstone of our wealth and power.\n\nOne says, "My friends are deeply misguided. I believe it is clear for all to see that without slaves no other industry could function!"\n\nAnother chimes in, "If I might crave your indulgence, [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip], our noble friend's perspective is unacceptably shortsighted. Without dyeworks and the many other trades that make up the process of creating dyes, the slaves would have barely any meaningful work to conduct!"\n\nThis elicited a pained guffaw from the first man while another spoke gesturing at the room. "With the greatest possible respect for my honored friends, I feel it necessary to remind us all that without pleasure houses, life itself would not be worth living."\n\nAs the laughter dies away I consider all the fine points they have made. But now they look to me waiting to hear what I have to say on the matter." #NT!
 agot_filler_tyrosh.0008.a: "I've found the slaving industry to be quite profitable." #NT!
 agot_filler_tyrosh.0008.b: "The dye industry cannot be matched." #NT!
 agot_filler_tyrosh.0008.c: "Pleasure houses are reliable, and everyone loves them!" #NT!
 agot_filler_tyrosh.0008.d: "Only a merchant's abilities matter, not the industry." #NT!
  
  # Admiring Tyroshi Hair and Beards # 
  
 agot_filler_tyrosh.0009.t: "A Peacock in His Pride" #NT!
 agot_filler_tyrosh.0009.desc: "Every day I see Tyroshi wear traditional hairstyles and colors, but occasionally I catch a glimpse of something truly unique. Sometimes a particularly pleasing arrangement of the hair and beard, or more rarely the debut of a new and brilliant shade. Today I am treated to both as a resplendent Tyroshi swaggers into my hall.\n\nBoth hair and beard are a violent shade of amethyst that catches the torchlight like a lightning storm! [admirable_tyroshi.GetHerHis|U] purple mane spills over well muscled shoulders and down [admirable_tyroshi.GetHerHis] back in large, wavy curls. The hair on [admirable_tyroshi.GetHerHis] skull is gathered into an array of buns held together by a series of carefully placed crystal hairpins and gem studded platinum combs all arranged to resemble a peacock in his pride.\n\n[admirable_tyroshi.GetHerHis|U] beard is smart and trimmed to end just above [admirable_tyroshi.GetHerHis] exposed chest but plaited many times over with jewels woven into the braids. By comparison [admirable_tyroshi.GetHerHis] mustache seems tame, yet still [admirable_tyroshi.GetSheHe] has managed to pomade and twirl it to perfection! Dare I allow such a specimen to go unnoticed?" #NT!
 agot_filler_tyrosh.0009.a: "I'll strike up a conversation!" #NT!
 agot_filler_tyrosh.0009.b: "Perhaps a fitting compliment will do..." #NT!
 agot_filler_tyrosh.0009.c: "Better to simply soak in [admirable_tyroshi.GetHerHis] visage." #NT!
  
  # Destitute Sellsword Begs for Work # 
  
 agot_filler_tyrosh.0010.t: "Painted Whore of Tyrosh" #NT!
 agot_filler_tyrosh.0010.desc: "On an otherwise quiet evening ride I hear the sound of a sellsword plying [tyroshi_sellsword.GetHerHis] services in a sing-song accent as [tyroshi_sellsword.GetSheHe] stumbles through the crowds in the middle of the street! I smell why as [tyroshi_sellsword.GetSheHe] comes nearer. [tyroshi_sellsword.GetSheHe|U] reeks of that unmistakable sellsword musk whose scent is dominated by the painful sting of ardent spirits and an unwashed backside.\n\nYet as [tyroshi_sellsword.GetSheHe] goes on telling all who will listen of [tyroshi_sellsword.GetHerHis] past exploits, I see [tyroshi_sellsword.GetSheHe] is no different from a pleasure girl grown too long in the tooth. [tyroshi_sellsword.GetHerHis|U] face paint consists of caked on dirt, sweat, and blood. [tyroshi_sellsword.GetHerHis|U] perfume is foul and flammable. Even the dye in [tyroshi_sellsword.GetHerHis] hair which must have once been some bright shade is faded and splotchy.\n\nYet on [tyroshi_sellsword.GetSheHe] goes undeterred by endless rejection. Adamant that [tyroshi_sellsword.GetSheHe] knows his trade as well as any man despite [tyroshi_sellsword.GetHerHis] condition. Ah the Tyroshi! Even the sellswords begging in the streets are braggarts!" #NT!
 agot_filler_tyrosh.0010.a: "I'll throw some coins [tyroshi_sellsword.GetHerHis] way." #NT!
 agot_filler_tyrosh.0010.b: "Such riffraff are best ignored." #NT!
 agot_filler_tyrosh.0010.c: "Perhaps [tyroshi_sellsword.GetSheHe] is available for hire?" #NT!
