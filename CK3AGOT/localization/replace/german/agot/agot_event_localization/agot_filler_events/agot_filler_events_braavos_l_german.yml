For ten days, citizens wear masks to symbolize the secrecy of Braavos's origins.

The festival is a jubilant and energetic affair, filled with music, performances, and street festivities.\n\nAs I join the crowd, a group of enthusiastic revelers mistakes me for a famed Braavosi figure, known for [meeting_noblemale.GetHersHis] daring exploits." #NT!

There, beneath the lantern-lit arches, a gathered crowd watches in silent awe as two bravos glide across the surface of the water, their blades flickering like silver in the dusk. This is water dancing — Braavosi swordplay at its most fluid and precise.\n\nNoticing my interest, a seasoned instructor, [meeting_warrior.GetFirstName], turns to me with a knowing smile. "Curious?"

"Ever raced to unseal the sea's little coffers?" [meeting_peasantmale.GetSheHe|U] asks. Apparently, the contest is simple: Pry open as many oysters as possible before time runs out. The prize?
