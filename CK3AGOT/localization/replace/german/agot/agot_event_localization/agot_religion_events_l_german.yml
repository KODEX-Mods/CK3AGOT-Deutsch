Though I am a considerable distance away, I can see that they are all the size of small islands. At least, that's what I'll be telling the traders back on shore.\n\nRegardless, my sailors and I can plainly see that they are worth a small fortune!" #NT!
 agot_religion_events.0701.desc_good: "A sudden shout from one of my sailors grabs my attention.\n\nI follow the growing shouts, turned heads, and outstretched fingers, and eventually I see a whale thrashing about in the distance.

My sailors groan and whine that we haven't seen any sign of a whale and that we will probably never see one at this rate.\n\nThough their laziness wounds me, I fear they are right.

As I gaze into the stone in my hand, hints of forgotten mysteries stir.\n\nAcross the ages great monuments have been hewn from this stone, and oily black obelisks rise where none should stand.

 agot_religion_events.1000.b: "A humble tribute" #NT!
 agot_religion_events.1000.b.tt: "A more modest offering, still meaningful, but not as extravagant. Perhaps enough to stir the stone's interest without arousing its wrath." #NT!
