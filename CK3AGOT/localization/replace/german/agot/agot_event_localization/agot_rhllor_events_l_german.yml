 agot_rhllor.0001.t: "The Last Hope" #NT!
 agot_rhllor.0001.multiple.desc: "Pain consumes me. My body is failing, torn and weakened by wounds that refuse to mend and sickness that festers deep within. I have tried every remedy, every desperate hope, yet my strength only wanes.\n\nThere is but one path left, one final chance before all is lost. The red priest speaks of fire, of the cleansing light that can burn away suffering. [red_priest.GetHerHis|U] words are bold, [red_priest.GetHerHis] faith unshaken. [red_priest.GetSheHe|U] claims the flames will heal what no mortal hands can mend.\n\nI do not know if I believe in [red_priest.GetHerHis] god, but I know I cannot endure this much longer." #NT!
 agot_rhllor.0001.wound.desc: "The wound festers, red and swollen, refusing to close no matter how it is tended. Every movement sends fresh agony through my body, a reminder of my own frailty.\n\nThere are few choices left to me. The red priest claims [red_priest.GetHerHis] fire can do what no blade or salve has managed. [red_priest.GetSheHe|U] says the flame purges weakness, that it can seal flesh and burn away the rot.\n\nPerhaps [red_priest.GetSheHe] is right. Perhaps [red_priest.GetSheHe] is mad. But if nothing is done, I will not live long enough to question [red_priest.GetHerHim]." #NT!
 agot_rhllor.0001.disease.desc: "I feel my strength slipping away, stolen by unseen hands. Each breath is a struggle, each day heavier than the last. The sickness lingers, unmoved by the remedies I have tried, uncaring of my will to fight.\n\nThe red priest speaks of fire, of the cleansing power that can burn away affliction. [red_priest.GetSheHe|U] swears that the flames do not lie, that they do not falter. If [red_priest.GetSheHe] is right, then this is my only chance.\n\nIf [red_priest.GetSheHe] is wrong, I will not have long to regret it." #NT!
 agot_rhllor.0001.deadly_curse.desc: "I feel myself slipping further with each passing day. This is not a wound that can heal, nor a sickness that will run its course. It is something deeper, something cruel and unrelenting.\n\nThere are those who say such afflictions cannot be undone, that they are simply fate, a burden that cannot be lifted. But the red priest does not believe in fate. [red_priest.GetSheHe|U] believes in fire. [red_priest.GetSheHe|U] claims that even the worst of curses can be burned away.\n\nPerhaps it is madness. Perhaps it is my only hope." #NT!

 agot_rhllor.0002.desc: "[patient.GetTitledFirstName] approaches, [patient.GetHerHis] steps heavy with suffering. I see the toll upon [patient.GetHerHis] body — wounds that refuse to mend, sickness that gnaws at [patient.GetHerHis] strength, a shadow of death creeping ever closer. [patient.GetSheHe|U] does not come to me as a believer, but as a desperate [Select_CString(patient.IsFemale,'woman','man')] grasping for salvation where no other remains.\n\nFire can cleanse. Fire can heal. But fire is not gentle. The Lord of Light does not grant his gifts freely — there is always a price. The question is whether [patient.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] is worthy of his mercy… or if [red_priest.GetSheHe] will burn in the attempt." #NT!

 agot_rhllor.0003.desc: "The red priest begins [red_priest.GetHerHis] ritual, murmuring sacred words as the flames rise higher, casting flickering shadows across the chamber. The heat swells, pressing against my skin — not just warmth, but something deeper, something alive.\n\n[red_priest.GetSheHe|U] speaks of R'hllor's light, of fire's power to cleanse and restore. But fire does not heal all things at once. I must choose which affliction I will entrust to [red_priest.GetHerHis] god's mercy." #NT!

 agot_rhllor.0007.patient.fail.desc: "The flames roared, the priest chanted, but nothing changed. I felt the heat, the weight of expectation, yet my body remained as it was — afflicted, weak. Was this R'hllor's judgment, or the priest's failure?" #NT!
 agot_rhllor.0007.patient.crit_fail.desc: "Pain like nothing I've ever known surged through me. The fire, meant to cleanse, instead ravaged my flesh, leaving me trembling, broken. The red priest's expression did not change, as though [red_priest.GetSheHe] had expected this. Had R'hllor truly abandoned me?" #NT!
 agot_rhllor.0007.patient.succ.desc: "The fire licked at my skin, but instead of pain, I felt warmth — deep, consuming, but not cruel. Slowly, my suffering lessened, my strength returned. I was still me, but whole again. The red priest watched in silence, [red_priest.GetHerHis] gaze unreadable." #NT!
 agot_rhllor.0007.patient.crit_succ.desc: "It was more than healing. The fire coursed through me, filling my limbs with renewed strength, sharpening my senses. I felt lighter, stronger, as if something greater than mere flesh had been restored. The priest studied me, [red_priest.GetHerHis] lips forming silent words of prayer." #NT!
 agot_rhllor.0007.red_priest.fail.desc: "The flames burned high, but the light did not answer. I felt the heat, I whispered the prayers, but the body before me remained unchanged. Was this soul unworthy, or had I misread the fire's will?" #NT!
 agot_rhllor.0007.red_priest.crit_fail.desc: "A warning. A punishment. The flames surged too fiercely, and before I could stop it, I saw the searing pain take hold. The ritual had failed, but more than that — the fire had devoured instead of cleansed. R'hllor had spoken, and his judgment was cruel." #NT!
 agot_rhllor.0007.red_priest.succ.desc: "The fire answered. Slowly, the affliction faded, the wounds mended, the suffering lifted. This was no ordinary healing — this was the will of the Lord of Light, and today, [patient.GetSheHe] had seen fit to grant mercy." #NT!
 agot_rhllor.0007.red_priest.crit_succ.desc: "I watched as the flames did more than heal — they transformed.
