My heart is pounding in my head. Rage boiling inside. I feel an inferno building in my body, my skin buzzing and alive with wrath. I don't notice myself standing, only realizing I am descending from the throne when I am halfway down it.\n\nWithout waiting for the judgment to finish, I take one of the Kingsguard's swords from their sheaths as I pass, and with a swing and a yell, I cleave the bastard's head clean from [reveal_scope.GetHerHis] body, the swordpoint cracking the stonework beneath. The court cries out in horror, but I cannot hear it over the sound of my own blood rushing through my head.\n\nI stand there amidst the gore, Targaryen blood once again coating the ground of the court. I look down at [reveal_scope.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] lifeless eyes, and I find no peace. The rage has not abated. Lyanna is still not here. The looks in my courtiers' eyes are the same I saw in the Mad King's court, and I wonder how it came to this." #NT!
