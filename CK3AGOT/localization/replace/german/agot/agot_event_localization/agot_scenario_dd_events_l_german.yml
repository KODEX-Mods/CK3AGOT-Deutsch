  # Rhaegar 
 agot_scenario_dd.1000.desc.rhaegar: "My council has come to me with grave news: My father, [aerys.GetTitledFirstNameRegnal], has been taken prisoner by [denys.GetTitledFirstName]!\n\nIn a foolhardy attempt to save his port from its inevitable decline, the Lord of Duskendale requested a charter of greater autonomy from the crown. [tywin.GetTitledFirstName], the Hand of the King, refused him. But the fool ceased paying his taxes, then invited the king directly to [duskendale.GetNameNoTier] to hear his petition.\n\nMy father, hoping to prove himself more than a figurehead, agreed to meet him without the Hand. Now he is a hostage, and [denys.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] has sworn to kill him should we storm the walls.\n\nMy father's life is now held by the Hand, and Seven Kingdoms wait to see how he will act." #NT!
  # Aerys 
 agot_scenario_dd.1000.desc.aerys: "When I came to [duskendale.GetNameNoTier], I had hoped to prove my strength. [denys.GetTitledFirstName] asked the crown for a royal charter, in some vain hope of saving his failing port, but [tywin.GetFirstName] swiftly rejected the petition — once again acting as though #italic he#! were the king, and I merely a fool on an uncomfortable chair.\n\nAt first I'd ignored when the Rat Lord of Duskendale ceased paying his taxes, asking for me to meet him to hear his petition myself. But then the Hand spoke against it. By what right does the #italic lion#! order the #italic dragon?!#! So, I rode to Duskendale, and now instead of a great hall I am in a cell. I can feel it growing smaller, the footsteps grow louder, the beating in my chest grows faster. I cannot tell if my mind is failing, or my heart.\n\n#bold Let me out!#!" #NT!
  # Denys 
 agot_scenario_dd.1000.desc.denys: "My ploy has worked! [aerys.GetTitledFirstNameRegnal] sits alone in a cell, huddled in a corner like a captured dog. I hear them now, calling me traitor across the realm. Is it treason to ask for that which your House has earned a hundred times and more?\n\nA charter to match the Dornish, that was my only request. With a charter I could save my port, with a charter I could bring my House to its former strength. Yet even after centuries of service, [tywin.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] rejection was swift. I was left at a fork in the road. I could let my House fall to ruin, or I could find a weakness in the lion's armor. I chose the latter.\n\nI knew [aerys.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] would ride to meet me when goaded; the man is a fool. He delivered himself to me like a freshly caught meal. Now I must extract what I need from him.\n\nI hope his #italic will#! is as weak as his #italic mind!#!" #NT!
  
 agot_scenario_dd.1000.opt.a: "I hope the Hand can save him." #NT!

  ## Scenario Setup Event for Tywin Lannister 
  # available scopes: aerys/rhaegar/denys/tywin/duskendale 
 agot_scenario_dd.0001.t: "The Captive Fool" #NT!
 agot_scenario_dd.0001.desc: "[aerys.GetTitledFirstNameRegnal] has been taken prisoner by his vassal, [denys.GetTitledFirstName]. #italic A pity...#!\n\nThe lord of [duskendale.GetNameNoTier] has been a nuisance to the Iron Throne for some time now. In some vain attempt to save his useless port, he requested a royal charter from the crown, granting him greater autonomy and lower tariffs. After being refused, the fool then decided to cease paying his taxes.\n\nThe king, as much the fool as [denys.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip], chose to ride to [duskendale.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip] on his own to resolve this dispute. Unsurprisingly, the king is now a prisoner, with the promise of death should there be signs of an assault. No doubt [denys.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] seeks to force my submission — and earn himself a charter in the bargain. The crown will appear weak indeed if I give in, but weaker still if the king is killed.\n\nRegardless, as the Hand of the King, I have called the small council to hear my decision. If nothing else, we cannot be silent." #NT!
  
 agot_scenario_dd.0001.opt.a: "Lord Denys shall have his charter." #NT!

 agot_scenario_dd.0002.t: "Word from the Caged King" #NT!
 agot_scenario_dd.0002.desc: "Just as I prepare to send word to [duskendale.GetNameNoTier], agreeing to give [denys.GetTitledFirstName] his charter, news arrives in the form of a letter sent, the messenger claims, by the king.\n\nI recognize it as being in the king's own hand, but hastily scrawled out and unevenly written. The letter begs us to give in, though it was clearly written under duress. I am certain that this means the king has been tortured, and my own certainty of course wavers.\n\nTo give in to a foe who would torture the king may be more damaging than the king himself dying in an attempted rescue. If one can capture the king with impunity, the crown itself has no cause to be feared. I must reevaluate, and be certain of my choice." #NT!
 agot_scenario_dd.0002.opt.a: "We ride to Duskendale, to war." #NT!

 agot_scenario_dd.0003.desc: "The Hand of the King has openly defied my father in his demands to break the agreement between the Crown and [denys.GetTitledFirstName]. I wish I was surprised, but the rift between them has been growing wider with each passing day. Still, this is dire news for the king, even if it means his freedom. With his Hand acting so brazenly against him, what will the rest of the realm think?\n\nIs my father losing his grasp on the throne? Is he even fit to rule any longer? If not, then it would fall to me to sit the Iron Throne in his stead. I fear [tywin.GetTitledFirstName] needs to have his power checked, for the sake of the crown. Removing him as Hand would mean an end to the deal, and open war. A hard choice, but could it be the right one?" #NT!
