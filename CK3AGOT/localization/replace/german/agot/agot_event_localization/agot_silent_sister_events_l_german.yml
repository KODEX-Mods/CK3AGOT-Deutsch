 agot_silent_sisters.0003.desc.volunteering: "[sister_candidate.GetName] has never been a difficult or particularly loud child. For this reason I am jolted when I hear a quiet rapping on my study door. Her face appears through the door crack as she slowly steps inside. "I....have a request." she says in a quiet voice, fiddling with her hands. Rarely one to speak up, this is a surprise. "What is it child?" I ask, gently prompting her.\n\n"I wish to join the Silent Sisters." she says, meeting my gaze with an uncharacteristic determination. "I wish to swear the vows and to dedicate my life in quiet service to the Seven". I am taken aback by this request. The Silent Sisterhood? For [sister_candidate.GetFirstName], my own daughter? A noble cause perhaps, but to live so extremely...even if it is what she wants, is this the life I want for her?" #NT!
 agot_silent_sisters.0003.desc.suggesting: "[sister_candidate.GetName] has never been a difficult or particularly loud child, and it has been evidently on display today. Apparently today she was praying in the sept when a horse that was let loose from the stables galloped in! Whether afraid to speak up or simply out of piety, [sister_candidate.GetFirstName] was the only one to not react at all!\n\nSuch a...different child she is. I wonder if the life of a noble lady is really the best thing for her. Will she be able to hold court, to keep a house organized, to raise children? Though I am surprised by the thought, I wonder if she should perhaps join the Silent Sisterhood? She seems the perfect candidate, and perhaps would lead a better life there. Yet, could I send my own daughter? They live so extremely...is this the life I want for her?" #NT!

 agot_silent_sisters.0004.desc: "In the quietude of my chamber, I sit by the flickering candlelight, pondering the path that lies ahead. My husband, no more. The castle feels empty, its stone walls colder than ever, echoing the hollowness within me.\n\nI've heard whispers among the women in the court, subtle suggestions that perhaps it's time for me to consider a life among the Silent Sisters. To be sworn to the service of the Stranger, the god of death. Forever cloaked in grey, face veiled except for my eyes, I would be taking a vow of silence and chastity, dedicating my life to preparing the dead for the afterlife.\n\nMy succession is secured, and perhaps my duty is done? I cannot deny the appeal such a detachment from the political day-to-day has. Yet, can I really renounce all worldly attachments and embrace silence?" #NT!

 agot_silent_sisters.0005.desc: "I am milling about before the funeral of [dead_relative.GetFirstName] when I see some servants carting a box into the sept where it is to be prepared for the funeral. Following it, a small group of Silent Sisters walking, heads bowed in prayer. Something about the way one of them moves...draws my eye in a most unholy manner. Without consciously choosing to, I find myself following them inside.\n\nWhen they lay [dead_relative.GetFirstNamePossessive] body on the slab and begin their morbid work I am shocked out of my stupor, the site of the blood of my blood running over the table enough to pull any man out of such thoughts. Yet, just in that moment, her eyes meet mine from across the corpse. Is that...the same spark back? Impossible though it is, I'm sure of it. She is #S interested#!!\n\nBefore I can do anything I am ushered out by one of the more attentive and significantly less attractive sisters through a series of gestures. To my shame, I cannot get her out of my mind for the rest of the funeral. They will be leaving on the morrow...yet, I know where she is staying...do I dare?" #NT!

 agot_silent_sisters.0006.desc: "[attractive_silent_sister.GetFirstName], as I later found her name was, opened the door quickly, and not a single word was exchanged before I was pulled into the room, then her bed, then her embrace. After unwrapping her body from its bonds, I found myself thinking that the Stranger is quite the lucky man. Clearly she was not thinking such though, and the silent carnal pleasure we enjoyed was anything but holy.\n\nAs we finished with a final silent gasp, I lay next to the most exposed woman I'd ever seen. We talked, her voice sweet to my ears, and she clearly had much to say after swearing silence for so long. While the pleasure this brought is undeniable, this is a sacrilege of the highest degree. What, then, shall I do now?" #NT!
