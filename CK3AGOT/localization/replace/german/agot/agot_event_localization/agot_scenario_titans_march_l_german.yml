 agot_titans_march.0001.desc: "How could this be? [daena.GetFirstName], my sister, my blood, has brought a bastard into the world, borne of her sins when she last escaped the Maidenvault. She has named the child [daemon.GetFirstName], but refuses to reveal the father.\n\nI have prayed for strength, for wisdom to guide me in this dark hour, but my prayers seem to go unanswered. The child's very existence seems a mockery of the purity I have so desperately sought. How can I remain the Blessed King when my own flesh and blood have succumbed to such weakness?\n\nI must be strong. For this child is but one among many trials that the Seven place before me. Perhaps the gods have seen fit to test me once more. I must find a way to redeem us all from this stain." #NT!

By right, it should pass to [daena.GetFirstName], the eldest living child of [egg3.GetTitledFirstNameRegnal]. However, [daena.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] is a wild and untamed and may be ill-suited for ruling. Her sisters could present a more measured choice: [rhaena.GetFirstName] is sweet and devout, and [elaena.GetFirstName] is sharp-witted and practical.\n\nYet, the girls have spent much of their lives in the Maidenvault, and it is possible that none of them would be able to rule effectively. Should their claims be set aside, the next in line would be [viserys.GetFirstName], who has proven himself a capable Hand, managing the realm through the reigns of three kings.\n\nWho will rise to fill the empty throne?" #NT!

 agot_titans_march.0301.desc: "My sister [daena.GetFirstName] has escaped the Maidenvault once again — this time, she has vanished with her son, [daemon.GetFirstName]. No one knows where she has gone, and there is no trace left behind. I fear that this time, she may not return. The shame of her actions stains our house, and I am powerless to stop her.\n\nHow many times must I endure this madness? The people whisper of her defiance, and my patience wears thin. Yet, my heart aches at the thought of her, lost somewhere in the world with the child that may very well carry her rebellious blood.

This is no mere place of worship; it is a monument to everything I have endeavored to embody: the devotion, the piety, and the unwavering love for the Seven that has guided me through every trial.\n\nYet, as I stand here, I cannot help but reflect on my journey — the countless moments I have strived to live as the gods would have me, and the many times I have faltered. Can I truly live up to this name, to the immense expectations now bound to this sacred place? Will I, in time, become the man worthy of such a legacy?" #NT!

A fitting tribute to a king who sought only the favor of the gods, yet tragically never lived to witness this day. His vision, his dream, has become a reality, but he is no longer here to bask in its glory.\n\nAs I stand before it, I cannot help but think of Baelor — the man he was, and the ruler he sought to become. His purity, his unshakable faith, and his deep devotion to the Seven — qualities that both elevated him and, in the eyes of many, led to his downfall." #NT!

We turned our eyes to the Stepstones, a collection of islands ripe for conquest. Yet, despite our efforts, the campaign ended in failure, and we were forced to pull out.\n\nNow, [GetTitleByKey('k_braavos').GetNameNoTier], ever watchful, has seen our retreat as a sign of weakness.

With the cold steel of treachery, he led a coup that saw me cast down, his own ambition propelling him to the seat of Sealord.
