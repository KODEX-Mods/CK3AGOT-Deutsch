As I step back though, [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] stops devouring it and instead approaches, head moving towards my bloody hand. At first, I think [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] wants more food, but instead [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] nuzzle my hand! [growing_dragon.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] is becoming quite sociable, and seems comfortable around anything [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')].\n\nThough such a nature may serve well in these walls, I do wonder how this will affect [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] combat abilities." #NT!

[growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')|U] is becoming more and more difficult to control [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHim')], lashing out at even minor inconveniences. Some of my servants are now even refusing to assist at feeding time, lest they be the unfortunate victim of [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] growing wrath.\n\nThough a fearsome beast has its benefits, I do wonder if this is the best path for [growing_dragon.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]." #NT!

 agot_dragon_personality.0003.desc: "Feeding time has become a delicate affair with [growing_dragon.GetFirstName], revealing a temperament as elusive as the morning mist. Today, when the handlers brought in a sheep, its bleating seemed to unsettle the young wyrm. Rather than approaching with the confidence of its kin, [growing_dragon.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] hung back, talons clicking apprehensively against stone.\n\nEach time the sheep moved, [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] shifted, as if the mere rustling of wool were a threat to be evaluated. It was only with gentle coaxing that [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] edged closer, flaring nostrils a sign of [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] lingering unease.

 agot_dragon_personality.0004.desc: "In order to preserve [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] natural instincts, I sometimes allow live prey to be hunted by [growing_dragon.GetFirstName]. Today I have locked a deer in with [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHim')], and [growing_dragon.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] has taken to the hunt with a ferocity I have not seen before, shredding flesh eagerly with powerful jaws.\n\nMore than that though, [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] seems to have left the creature still alive! Rather than burning the meat before eating as before, [growing_dragon.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] looks to be savoring the blood and viscera in its maw.

 agot_dragon_personality.0005.desc: "The concern was less the wall repairs and more the step beforehand. Ushering a dragon like [growing_dragon.GetFirstName] elsewhere, even temporarily, is not a task to be approached lightly.\n\nAs the craftsmen approached, I expected [growing_dragon.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] to greet them with a territorial snarl. However, [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] simply lifted [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] gaze, eyes shimmering with an intelligence that transcended beastly instinct. With a dignified stretch of [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] wings [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] ambled forth, each step deliberate and unhurried, [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] tail sweeping gently behind. [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')|U] settled in a new location with a tranquility that eased the tension of the moment.\n\nThe workers began their toil, casting glances of gratitude and respect towards the dragon who watched them with a placid curiosity." #NT!
