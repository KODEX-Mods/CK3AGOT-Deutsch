 agot_birth_events.0003.desc: ""Just one more push, my [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord], just one more! The baby is almost here!" A scream escapes my lips as I bear down for the last time. The pain is everywhere, it's too much, it's overwhelming — and then, it seems like it's over.... I did it.\n\n"Is my child alright?!" I barely recognize my own voice. "Is... Is it a [child.Custom('GirlBoy')]?"\n\nThe midwife does not answer me, does not even look at me. No, she only has her eyes for the unmoving bundle in her arms." #NT!

 agot_birth_events.0004.desc: "The midwife finally exits the birth chamber, her face is pale and she refuses to look me in the face.\n\n"I am so sorry my [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord|U]. The child was born... misshapen." Her tone says it all. I enter the room where the stench of death hangs, and [mother.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] holds to her breast a small, unmoving creature. Its scaled skin and vestigial wings would make it unrecognizable as human if not for the hair that [mother.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] runs [mother.GetHerHim] fingers through.\n\nMy [child.Custom('GetDaughterSon')] has been born a monster." #NT!
 agot_birth_events.0004.a: "Such a tragedy." #NT!

 agot_birth_events.0005.desc:0 "The pain is #bold unbearable#!.\n\nBetween wrenching gasps and flashes hot as lightning ripping through my body, I swear I can hear a dragon's roar. Then... there's #italic nothing#!.\n\nSilence cradles the room, swaddling those present in a stillness unbroken by breath. At long last, [second_adult.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] pierces the quiet: "The pain is #bold unbearable#!.\n\nBetween wrenching gasps and flashes hot as lightning ripping through my body, I swear I can hear a dragon's roar. Then... there's #italic nothing#!.\n\nSilence cradles the room, swaddling those present in a stillness unbroken by breath. At long last, [second_adult.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] pierces the quiet: "My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord|l], your babe... is here."\n\nI hadn't even noticed [second_adult.GetHerHim] handing me the child — if child is truly what [child.GetSheHe] is.\n\nIn my arms, tossing fitfully, #bold lies a#! #NEG monster#!." #NT!

 agot_birth_events.0006.desc: "The screams from the bedchamber grow increasingly frantic, ripping through the air like a dragon clawing its way from confinement. #italic Poor, sweet [mother.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]... This baby may kill her...#!\n\nThe sudden silence jolts my senses. #italic It is done#!, I think, but I pause momentarily before entering — to compose myself, to steel myself for what may await me.\n\nThe carnage of the birthing leaves me aghast. My dear [mother.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], smock soaked in blood, holds the babe close to her chest. But her pained look frightens me as I approach to see my spawn.\n\nHere, before my eyes, is no mere child. Here is #bold a monster#!." #NT!

 agot_birth_events.0100.desc: "With the birth of [child.GetName], the question of forming my own house looms before me. My brother, [daemon.GetFirstNameNicknamed] formed his own house, and now all men know to fear the name Blackfyre. It is time to decide if men should hear the name Bittersteel and feel the same way." #NT!

 agot_birth_events.0101.desc: "The great Valyrian steel sword, [vs_blackfyre.GetName], has come into my possession. It is the ultimate symbol of Targaryen power, prowess, and legitimacy.\n\nBut I am no Targaryen. As a bastard, I could never claim the legacy associated with [vs_blackfyre.GetNameNoTooltip]. But perhaps I could form my own house, one that undoubtedly reflects the history and status of the sword..." #NT!
