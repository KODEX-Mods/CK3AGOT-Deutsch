Each of them strains against the challenge, red faces and sweaty brows dotting the unwashed lot of would-be warriors.

Just then, an unmistakable sound of laughter, high-pitched as if belonging to a child, reaches us from deeper within the forest. Soon other, similarly childish voices join the chorus of seemingly amused snickering that echoes, disturbingly, all around us." #NT!

The frustration fuels my anger, but eventually the need to catch breath takes priority over the chase and I realize that I left my party far behind.

Our effort to prepare for nightfall is audibly no small source of amusement for the Children, as the laughter picks up every time we start a new task, but by the time we settle in it dies down and gives way to a somewhat more distant sound of singing. Getting their fill of novelty, the Children of the Forest decided to spend their evening sharing a song, the same way we often do. But we dare not compete, as their singing is more beautiful than anything any of us have ever heard.
