I unleash [sieging_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] flames upon it, and the wagon is quickly engulfed in fire, the defenders' supplies going up in smoke. Just the first of our strikes!\n\nA tower, a guard post, and an external stable all fall to [sieging_dragon.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] flames, but as we bank up from the burning stable below I feel a sudden impact, and a sharp pain in my side.\n\nI shout in pain, looking down to see the arrow embedded in my abdomen, red stain spreading across my torso.

With a turn of my heels, I direct [sieging_dragon.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] to hover above the courtyard, and rain dragonflame down on the helpless sods below.\n\nBut as we burn men beneath our mighty presence, I feel a sudden heat in my side, and I shout as it radiates into pain. I look down to see the arrow embedded in my abdomen, and up to see the lucky archer who had managed to strike me from the walls. With a roar we burn him ash too, but I cannot stay here now, and I wheel [sieging_dragon.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] around to return to our lines." #NT!

Try as we might to avoid it, the spear strikes [sieging_dragon.GetNameNoTooltip] in the side, and I feel the force of [sieging_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] pain as [sieging_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] lurches back, roaring in a mix of anger and agony." #NT!

Above the archway a group of defenders have been waiting on an adjacent roof, and as we swoop down they #italic jump#! towards [sieging_dragon.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]!\n\nThough many miss and shatter on the stone beneath, some of the brave fools find purchase, their downward thrusts finding their mark and digging the men onto [sieging_dragon.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] held by their spears and swords.

We have been burning their defenses from one side of the keep to the other, focusing on those which may house weapons and men before turning on those that would block our men from entering.\n\nAs we turn to the last of these, I see a lone man on a horse — somehow having managed to escape the flames — ride towards us, a spear in his hand as if to lance us! Such bravery, or foolishness, I cannot tell, but as I direct [sieging_dragon.GetNameNoTooltip] to turn and face him, I am surprised to see the man's spear fly from his hands, and strike me square in the chest! The air is driven from my lungs, and I cannot even howl with [sieging_dragon.GetFirstNameNoTooltip].\n\nI am dimly aware of the lurch as [sieging_dragon.GetNameNoTooltip] rises into the sky, my limp form strapped down, head lolling back to stare at the sky.
