 agot_ninepenny.0001.desc: ""Each of us shall carve out a kingdom onto ourselves," [adarys.GetName] proclaims, beneath the great Tree of Crowns in the Disputed Lands. My birthright will be hard-won — even wresting control of the Golden Company was no easy feat. Now, before me kneel nine of the most heinous outlaws in Essos... The type of support only one known as [ROOT.Char.GetNickname] could secure.\n\nWith [saan.GetNickname], [old_mother.GetFirstNameNicknamed], [butcher.GetNickname], [bad_apple.GetNickname], [nine_eyes.GetNickname], [ebon_prince.GetNickname], and [lashare.GetNickname] at my back... The Iron Throne will be mine. But [ROOT.Char.Custom('BlackfyreRebellions')|l] will require careful measure, as my next steps will surely send ripples that will reach the small council of the Seven Kingdoms. #bold I must make haste, lest my enemies bring the war to me.#!" #NT!

 agot_ninepenny.0002.desc.tyrosh: "With Tyrosh in the capable hands of my ally [adarys.GetNameNicknamed], the Band of Nine becomes ever stronger. A worthy prize in my eyes: [daemon.GetFirstNameNicknamed] once called Tyrosh home, and Blackfyre support will not be hard to come by with a new tyrant — erm, archon.\n\nFortune favors the bold, and I must make my next move with haste. The lords of Westeros have doubtless heard rumor of my menace." #NT!
 agot_ninepenny.0002.desc.lys: "A pirate's lands for a pirate king: No one is better suited to rule Lys the Lovely than [saan.GetNameNicknamed]. The wealth of the city will greatly support my cause, as well — and who can resist a visit to the Perfumed Garden to relieve the stress of war.\n\nBut time is of the essence, and I must make my next move with haste. News of the Band of Nine's exploits will have surely reached Westeros by now." #NT!
 agot_ninepenny.0002.desc.pentos: "Conquering Pentos for my ally [nine_eyes.GetNameNicknamed] will be a great boon for the Band of Nine: a valuable port directly across the Narrow Sea from King's Landing — and my birthright. The city proved to be as vulnerable as tales made jest.\n\nA faint heart never won a fair lady, and my prize is far greater than a mere dame. I must make quick action, riding this momentum to my kingdom." #NT!
 agot_ninepenny.0002.desc.myr: "Myr is an exalted prize for [lashare.GetNameNicknamed], and his rule will embolden the Band of Nine: Though matters of art and learning are of little interest to me, the Sea of Myrth provides a strategic foothold en route to Westeros.\n\nOur power grows, but so does our peril. The Seven Kingdoms could bring their collective might against my motley alliance at any moment." #NT!
 agot_ninepenny.0002.desc.stepstones: "With the Band of Nine now holding the Stepstones, I am now within striking distance from the Iron Throne — a powerful position to hold, and yet vulnerable to maintain. My enemies will no doubt take note of the growing Blackfyre Host, so I must be prepared for an attack at any moment if I don't move on the Seven Kingdoms myself.\n\nMy birthright is so close, I can taste it... The metallic tang of blood and iron... My destiny, the dream of the Black Dragon, awaits." #NT!
 agot_ninepenny.0002.desc: "With the untimely death of [claimant.GetName] there is little reason for us to continue a war for a dead [claimant.GetWomanMan].

Yet there are those in my realm who will doubt my legitimacy; it behooves me to do all I can to tighten my grip around the neck of Westeros.\n\nIf I were to take a Targaryen bride, none would doubt the lineage of our children.
